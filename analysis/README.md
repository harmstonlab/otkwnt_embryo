Main folder for analysis code used in this project. 

## File types
Each analysis file comes in three flavours, and are used for various purposes. 

* To view on GitHub: `.md`
* To reproduce analysis: `.qmd`. 

I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to render `.qmd` files, generating the `md` files. 

## Useful links 
* Preprocessing scripts for `STAR` and `RSEM`: [scripts/preprocess](../scripts/preprocess/)
* Outputs: [output/](../output/). All `RDS` files are on the server. 
* Raw data: [data/01_data_raw](../data/01_data_raw/)
* Processed data (STAR, RSEM outputs): [data/02_data_processed](../data/02_data_processed/)
