Each analysis file comes in three flavours, and are used for various purposes. 

* To view on GitHub: `.md`
* To download and view: `.html` (best experience)
* To reproduce analysis: `.qmd`. 

I use [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to render `.qmd` files, generating the `md` files. 

To render: Run `quarto render <file> --to html,gfm` in the terminal. The order is important - html first, before gfm - otherwise html will delete/ replace the md file generated by gfm.
